Building HttpComponents Client for Android 
============================

(1) Requisites
--------------
Android SDK rev. 17 (4.2.2 or Jelly Bean MR1) or newer is required in order 
to compile HttpClient for Android. Android SDK can be downloaded either separately 
or bundled with Android Studio.   

HttpClient for Android utilizes Gradle as a building and packaging tool.
Version 1.10 or later is recommended.

Gradle installation and configuration instructions can be found here:

http://www.gradle.org/

(2) Building artifacts 

Set environmental variable ANDROID_HOME to the location of the Android SDK.

Execute the following command in order to build binary, source and javadoc artifacts.

gradle -q assemble

Please note that when building a release version (project version does not have 
'-SNAPSHOT' qualifier) one must also provide signing key details in gradle.properties
file in order to be able to sign the artifacts and successfully build the release. 

---
signing.keyId=AEAEAEAE
signing.secretKeyRingFile=~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
---

The artifacts can be found in the 'build/libs' folder

build/libs/httpclient-android-<VERSION>.jar
build/libs/httpclient-android-<VERSION>-javadoc.jar
build/libs/httpclient-android-<VERSION>-sources.jar

(3) Troubleshooting

Building version 4.3.3 with Gradle 1.11 fails. Please use Gradle 1.10.
